## Description

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In the game, there are two players: the user and the computer.
The user can start the game by clicking on one of the three available images representing 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.
Once the user makes a selection, the computer randomly picks its own choice.
The two choices are then compared to determine the outcome.

If the user wins, a message appears saying "Your choice beat the computer's choice."

If the computer wins, it shows "Computer beats your choice."

If both choices are the same, it displays "It's a draw. Try again!"

The scores for both the user and the computer are updated accordingly after each round.
