This is a rock paper scissor project created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In this project, there are two players, one the user and the other is the computer. 
There are three choices of each image of 'Rock', 'Paper' and 'Scissor' where the user can click to begin the game. 
If the user clicks any of the choice then the computer
randomly selects one choice and the choices are compared. If the user wins a message in shown in the button stating 'Your choice beat computer choice.' If the computer wins it shows 'Computer beats your choice'. And if the choices are same it displays 'It is draw. Try Again!'. The winning scores simultaneously increases for both players.
